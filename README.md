Website with recipes. On the home you can find links to various recipes. Recipe page contain an image of the finished
dish, "Description" (a paragraph or two) describing the recipe. Under the description an "Ingredients" heading followed by
an unordered list. Finally, under the ingredients list added a "Steps" heading followed by an ordered list of the steps
