    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        This is my mother's recipe. Everyone, German or not, loves it. It is easy to double the recipe as well. I often
        bring it to potlucks, and we also have it at home on special occasions. There are usually no leftovers, but if
        there are, they don't last long!
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>3 cups diced peeled potatoes</li>
        <li>4 slices bacon</li>
        <li>1 small onion, diced</li>
        <li>¼ cup white vinegar</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons water</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Place the potatoes into a pot, and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for about 10
            minutes, or until easily pierced with a fork. Drain, and set aside to cool.</li>
        <li>Place the bacon in a large deep skillet over medium-high heat. Fry until browned and crisp, turning as
            needed. Remove from the pan and set aside.</li>
        <li>Add onion to the bacon grease, and cook over medium heat until browned. Add the vinegar, water, sugar, salt
            and pepper to the pan. Bring to a boil, then add the potatoes and parsley. Crumble in half of the bacon.
            Heat through, then transfer to a serving dish. Crumble the remaining bacon over the top, and serve warm.
        </li>
    </ol>
