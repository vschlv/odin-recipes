    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>
        Make this classic lasagna recipe zestier by using hot Italian sausage or a little milder with regular Italian
        sausage. Don't be scared off by the long cooking time. The wait is well worth it. It's a great dish to make for
        a crowd and easy to adjust for varying tastes. The leftovers are even better when reheated the next day.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>9 lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>1 pound bulk Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 (16 ounce) can sliced mushrooms, drained</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>¼ teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>4 (15 ounce) cans tomato sauce</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 (15 ounce) container ricotta cheese</li>
        <li>3 eggs, beaten</li>
        <li>⅓ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1 pound shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the lasagna noodles and olive oil; cook until al
            dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain.</li>
        <li>Cook the ground beef and sausage in a large pot over medium heat; drain. Stir in the mushrooms, garlic salt,
            oregano, thyme, basil, and tomato sauce. Season with salt and pepper; simmer 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, mix together the ricotta cheese, eggs, and Parmesan cheese in a bowl.</li>
        <li>Ladle enough of the meat sauce into a 9x13 inch baking dish to cover the bottom in a thin layer. Form a
            layer atop the sauce with 3 of the lasagna noodles. Spread about 1/4 of the ricotta cheese mixture over the
            noodles. Sprinkle about 1/3 of the mozzarella cheese over the ricotta cheese mixture and then ladle about
            1/3 of the meat sauce over the mozzarella cheese. Repeat layering twice more, topping with the remaining 1/4
            pound of mozzarella cheese.</li>
        <li>Bake in preheated oven 90 minutes. Allow to sit 10 to 15 minutes before serving.</li>
