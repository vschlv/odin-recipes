        <li>¼ teaspoon pepper</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <ol>
        <li>Combine water, rice vinegar, lemon juice, soy sauce, and orange juice for sauce into a saucepan over
            medium-high heat. Stir in brown sugar, green onion, orange zest, ginger, garlic, and pepper flakes; bring to
            a boil. Remove from heat, and cool for 10 to 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place chicken in a resealable plastic bag. Pour in 1 cup cooled sauce. Seal the bag, and refrigerate for at
            least 2 hours. Reserve the remaining sauce.</li>
        <li>Mix flour, salt, and pepper in another resealable plastic bag.</li>
        <li>Remove chicken from the marinade and place into the bag of seasoned flour. Seal the bag and shake to coat.
        </li>
        <li>Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot skillet until browned on
            both sides. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate and cover with aluminum foil. Wipe out the skillet.</li>
        <li>Pour reserved sauce into the skillet and bring to a boil over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Mix together cornstarch and water until completely smooth. Stir into the boiling sauce. Reduce heat to
            medium-low, add the chicken, and simmer, stirring occasionally, until cooked through, about 5 minutes.</li>
